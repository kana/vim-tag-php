==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*tag-php-introduction*

*tag-php* is a |tag-user| plugin to enhance |CTRL-]| for PHP.

- Jump to a proper static method even if there are multiple methods which have
  the same name among many classes.  For example, if the cursor is located at
  `d` of `Foo::doSomething();`, |CTRL-]| jumps to `doSomething` defined in
  `Foo` rather than `doSomething` in other classes.

- Jump to a static method even if the cursor is located on a class name.  For
  example, if the cursor is located at `F` of `Foo::doSomething();`, |CTRL-]|
  jumps to `doSomething` defined in `Foo` rather than `Foo` itself.
